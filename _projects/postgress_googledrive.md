<h2>Nothing new here...</h2>

This project was actually the first thing I considered meaningful and useful enough to share it with the world. This motivated me to build this site. Initially, I planned for this site to purely be a blog, thus I wrote my first blog post for this project. I don't think it's necessary to provide a second write up here. Thus, find the description for this project <a href="https://www.finnrietz.dev/python/linux/postgres-backup-googledrive/">here</a>.
