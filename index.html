<h1>About me</h1>
Hey, I am Finn. Currently, I'm working on getting my Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Hamburg, Germany. 
I've got a Bachelor in Human-Computer Interaction, which is an interdisciplinary study path, seeking to combine cognitive principals 
from Psychology with Computer Science.
<br><br>
Though, during the three years of completing that degree, I've developed a greater interest in other areas of Computer Science, 
mainly in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Data Science, which leads me to this website.
<br><br>


<h1>About this site</h1>
You can expect the majority of issues here to be related to Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, advanced Python programming, 
and Linux Sysadmin tools. There are multiple reasons for me to write about a topic: I will write about a topic when I feel like there is a 
non-trivial problem at hand, for which I couldn't quickly find a solution online. However, give that I learn about topics that I find
highly exciting on almost a weekly basis, I might just write about something because I personally enjoy the topic. 
<br><br>
I have read many great blogs and tutorials, but also some that didn't delight me as much. I try to build upon that, contribute to the 
community, and fill gaps where I experience a lack of material and documentation. However, you might also find me writing about 
topics that are already well covered (like the different versions and implementations of the Gradient Descent Algorithm), in which 
case I simply wanted to take my spin on the topic ;)
<br><br>

If at the end of the day, a handful of people found something useful on this blog, I am happy and would see this as an absolute win. 
<br><br>

Yours, 
<i>Finn Rietz.</i>
