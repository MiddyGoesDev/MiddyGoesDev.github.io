<h1>About me</h1>
Hej, I'm Finn Rietz, an AI enthusiast and computer scientist from Germany. I am currently employed as a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://amm.aass.oru.se/" target="_blank">Autonomous Mobile Manipulation Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.oru.se/english/research/research-environments/ent/AASS/" target="_blank">Ã–rebro University</a> under the <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/" target="_blank">WASP program</a>.

My research interests are, broadly speaking, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Explainable AI (XAI), and Robotics. 
I believe that the DRL framework has immense potential for industry automation and optimization, but also think that the intransparency of Deep Neural Network-based AI systems must be addressed for safe real-world employment of these technologies. 
This is the overall problem I hope to contribute towards within the scope of my Ph.D.

<h1>About this site</h1>
This sites is subject to mainly two ideas:<br>
Firstly, I want to contribute to the community and share my knowledge about topics I care about, especially where I experienced a lack of material or documentation. 
However, you might also find me writing about topics that are already well covered, in which case I simply wanted to take my spin on a topic. This addresses the blog posts you find on this website.
<br><br>

Secondly, this website serves as my digital business card. Hence, you find some of my projects on here as well. These aim at illustrating a part of my skill-set and, unlike the blog posts, they are not primarily meant to be educational resources (although they might still be informational for some).
