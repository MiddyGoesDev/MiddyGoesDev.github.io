<h1>About me</h1>
Hey, I'm Finn Rietz, an AI enthusiast and computer scientist from Germany.
I am currently employed as a Ph.D. student at the <a href="http://ails.aass.oru.se/" target="_blank">Adaptive and Interpretable Learning Systems Lab</a>, funded by the <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/" target="_blank">WASP program</a>.
Starting from 01.03.23, I am also appointed as leader of the WASP Reinforcement Learning (RL) cluster, which is a group of ~50 RL and Robotics researchers.
<br><br>

My research interests are, broadly speaking, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Transfer Learning, and Robotics.
I believe that the DRL framework has immense potential for industry automation and optimization, but also think that the intransparency and data inefficiency of deep neural network-based AI systems must be addressed for safe and efficient real-world employment of these technologies.

<h1>About this site</h1>
This sites is subject to mainly two ideas:<br>
Firstly, I want to contribute to the community and share my insight about topics I care about, especially where I experienced a lack of material or documentation.
However, you might also find me writing about topics that are already well covered, in which case I simply wanted to take my spin on a topic.
This addresses the blog posts you find on this website, which are meant to be of educational nature, at least to some extent.
<br><br>

Secondly, this website serves as my digital business card.
Hence, you find some of my projects on here as well.
These aim at illustrating a part of my skill-set and, unlike the blog posts, they are not primarily meant to be educational resources (although they might still be informational for some).
I might also write about purely for fun projects that I did.
<br><br>
