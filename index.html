<h1>About me</h1>
Hey, I am Finn. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, especially in one intersection of these two fields: The Deep Reinforcement Learning framework.  

Currently, I am working at the <a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm/" target="_blank">KT research group</a> and writing my Master's thesis on explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning.
In 2022, I start my Ph.D studies at the <a href="https://amm.aass.oru.se/" target="_blank">Autonomous Mobile Manipulation Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.oru.se/english/research/research-environments/ent/AASS/" target="_blank">Ã–rebro University</a> under the <a href="https://www.oru.se/english/research/research-environments/ent/AASS/" target="_blank">WASP program</a>.

<h1>About this site</h1>
This sites is subject to mainly two ideas:<br>
Firstly, I want to contribute to the community and share my knowledge about topics I care about, especially where I experienced a lack of material or documentation. 
However, you might also find me writing about topics that are already well covered, in which case I simply wanted to take my spin on a topic. This addresses the blog posts you find on this website.
<br><br>

Secondly, this website serves as my digital business card. Hence, you find some of my projects on here as well. These aim at illustrating a part of my skill-set and, unlike the blog posts, they are not primarily meant to be educational resources.  
<br><br>

Cheers, 
<i>Finn Rietz.</i>
