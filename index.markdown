    <p class="next-to-author"> Hey, I am Finn. Currently, I'm working on getting my Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Hamburg, Germany. I've got a Bachelor in Human-Computer Interaction, which is an interdisciplinary study path, seeking to combine cognitive principals from Psychology with Computer Science. </p>

    <p> Though, during the three years of completing that degree, I've developed a greater interest in other areas of Computer Science, mainly in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. </p>
    <p> This leads me to this website and blog. You can expect the majority of issues here to be related to <span class="text-highlight-red">Machine Learning</span>, <span class="text-highlight-red">Artificial Intelligence</span>, advanced <span class="text-highlight-red">Python programming</span>, and <span class="text-highlight-red">Linux Sysadmin tools</span>. I will write about a topic when I feel like there is a non-trivial problem at hand, for which I couldn't quickly find a solution online. </p>
    <p> I have read many great blogs and tutorials, but also some that didn't delight me as much. I try to build upon that, contribute to the community, and fill gaps where I experience a lack of material and documentation. However, you might also find me writing about topics that are already well covered, in which case I simply wanted to take my spin on the topic ;) </p>
