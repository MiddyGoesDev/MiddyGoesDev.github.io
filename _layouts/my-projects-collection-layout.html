<!-- 
This is a bit hacky and not how this theme is supposed to be used at all, anyway:
we close here the surround class div, which takes the layout: archive as given in the header.
Then, we just create a second archive div and put our second collection in there, which allows us to have two collections on one page 
without breaking any layouting :)
