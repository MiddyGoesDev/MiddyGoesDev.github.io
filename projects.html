<p>
  For all projects (that I publish here), I provide a brief write-up of what the
  purpose of the project is, what I learned when working on the project and what the key
  outcome is. Contrary to the blog-posts, the goal behind these write-ups is
  not to fully explain the implementation or underlying principle, but rather to illustrate
  a bit of my skill-set.
