<p>
  For the bellow projects, I provide a brief write-up of what the
  purpose of the project is, what I learned while working on the project and what the key
  outcome is. Contrary to the blog-posts, the goal behind these write-ups is
  not to fully explain the implementation or underlying principle, but rather to illustrate
  parts of my skill-set. I don't explicitly list all my projects here, as some are featured 
  either elsewhere on this site or somewhere on the internet already.
